Occasionally, Amazon requires verification of account ownership and will email you a code during login. If this happens during an order, you will receive an `account_locked_verification_required` error.

## Why This Happens

Amazon may require email verification for several reasons:
- **New account activity** from an unfamiliar location
- **Suspicious login patterns** or multiple failed attempts
- **Account security measures** triggered by automated ordering
- **Policy compliance** requirements

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Manual Verification Code

Check the email associated with your Amazon account and obtain the verification code. Then resubmit your order and supply the code as `verification_code` under the `retailer_credentials` object.

```json
{
  "retailer_credentials": {
    "email": "your-email@example.com",
    "password": "your-password",
    "verification_code": "123456"
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Two-Factor Authentication

Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on your Amazon account and supply the `totp_2fa_key` with every order under the `retailer_credentials` object.

<Info>
  Using 2FA is the most secure and reliable method for avoiding verification issues.
</Info>

```json
{
  "retailer_credentials": {
    "email": "your-email@example.com",
    "password": "your-password",
    "totp_2fa_key": "JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP"
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Zinc Managed Accounts

Use **Zinc Managed Accounts** where we manage keeping accounts open and unlocked. This eliminates the need for manual verification and provides the highest reliability for automated ordering.

### Option 4: Email Forwarding

Forward all emails from your Amazon account's email to `email@quail.zinc.io`. AutoOrdering will automatically parse the incoming email and fill in the verification code.

## Error Response

When verification is required, you'll receive an error response like this:

  "message": "Amazon requires email verification. Please provide verification_code in retailer_credentials.",
  "data": {
    "retailer": "amazon",
    "account_email": "your-email@example.com"
  }
}
```
