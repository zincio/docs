openapi: 'POST /v1/orders/{request_id}/cancel'

The Zinc API supports pre-shipment order cancellation on Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk.

<Note>
You can only cancel an order after it has been successfully placed using the API
</Note>

This is distinct from [aborting an order](/api-reference/orders/abort), which occurs while the order is still in progress. Cancellations will send a cancellation request to the retailer and attempt to stop the order from shipping and can only be initiated for order requests that were successful.
