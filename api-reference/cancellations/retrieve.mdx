You will receive either a `request_processing` response, an error response, or a successful cancellation response of type `cancellation_response`.

## Attempting to Cancel State

In approximately 50% of cases, Amazon cannot immediately cancel an order and will respond with an "attempting to cancel" status:

```json Example attempting_to_cancel Response
{
  "_type": "error",
  "code": "attempting_to_cancel",
  "message": "The retailer is attempting to cancel the order.",
  "data": {
    "msg": "Attempting to cancel order"
  },
  "request": {
    ...
  }
}
```

<Info>
**Processing Time:** When a cancellation enters the `attempting_to_cancel` state, Zinc will continue polling the retailer to determine the final status. No guarantees can be made for how long this will take.

### State Transitions

The `attempting_to_cancel` state is temporary and will eventually resolve to one of:
- **Successful cancellation** - Order was cancelled successfully
- **Failed cancellation** - Cancellation was rejected or failed

### Webhook Behavior

If you're using webhooks, you'll receive notifications for state changes:

1. **Initial `attempting_to_cancel`** - `request_failed` webhook is triggered
2. **Final resolution:**
   - If cancellation succeeds → `request_succeeded` webhook
   - If cancellation fails → `request_failed` webhook (again with updated response)

<Tip>
Using webhooks eliminates the need to poll the cancellation request ID for status updates.
