When integrating with Zinc, you have two options for paying for purchases:

## 1. Bring Your Own Account

You provide your own retailer account credentials (e.g., Amazon username and password) and Zinc will place orders on your behalf using your account.

**Benefits:**
- Full control over your orders and account.
- Use your own payment methods (e.g., credit cards for cashback, points, etc.).
- Access to your retailer's loyalty programs and purchase history.

**Considerations:**
- You are responsible for maintaining your retailer accounts.
- Retailers may occasionally lock or restrict accounts due to high activity or policy changes.

## 2. Zinc Managed Accounts (ZMA)

Let Zinc handle everything. With ZMA, you fund a balance with Zinc (via PayPal or wire transfer), and Zinc places orders using its own managed retailer accounts.

**Benefits:**
- No need to create or manage your own retailer accounts.
- Zinc handles account maintenance, order placement, and fulfillment.
- Reduced risk of account shutdowns or interruptions.

**How it works:**
1. **Fund your account:**  
   Add funds to your Zinc balance via PayPal or wire transfer.  
   - Check your balance:  
     ```bash
     curl "https://api.zinc.io/v1/addax/balance" -u <client_token>:
     ```
   - View transactions:  
     ```bash
     curl "https://api.zinc.io/v1/addax/transactions?count=100&offset=0" -u <client_token>:
     ```
   - Contact [sales@zinc.io](mailto:sales@zinc.io) to set up funding options.

2. **Place an order:**  
   - Add `"addax": true` to your order request body.
   - Do **not** include `retailer_credentials`, `payment_method`, or `billing_address`.
   - All other order features work as usual.

3. **Order processing:**  
   - Orders are queued until a suitable fulfillment account is available.
   - If an order cannot be fulfilled in time, you'll receive a `zma_temporarily_overloaded` error.

4. **Cases & support:**  
   - If an order is cancelled, returned, or needs follow-up, Zinc will open a "case" for you.
   - You can check or update case status via the API.

**Considerations:**
- ZMA is currently available for Amazon.com only.
- You'll still be billed the normal ordering fee at the end of the month.
