To use the Zinc API, you must authenticate every request with your client token.

<Info>
  You can find your client token in your <a href="https://dash.zinc.io" target="_blank">Zinc dashboard</a> after creating an account.
</Info>

## Example Authentication Request

```bash
curl https://api.zinc.io/v1/orders \
  -u <client_token>:
```

Authentication is performed using **HTTP Basic Auth**.  
- Your **client token** is used as the username.
- The password field should be left blank.

<Alert type="warning">
Never share your client token or expose it in public repositories, client-side code, or other insecure locations. Your client token is tied to your account, and you are responsible for all requests made with it.
</Alert>

If you believe your client token has been compromised, please contact [support@zinc.io](mailto:support@zinc.io) immediately.
