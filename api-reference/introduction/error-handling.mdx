When a request to the Zinc API fails, you'll receive a structured error response.

## Example Error Response

```json
{
  "_type": "error",
  "code": "product_unavailable",
  "message": "One of the products you selected is unavailable.",
  "data": { "product_id": "018293801" }
}
```

Every error object contains:
- **code**: A short, unique error code describing the error.
- **message**: A human-readable message for developers (not end users).
- **data**: Additional information about the error (e.g., product ID, max quantity, etc.).
