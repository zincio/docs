Idempotency keys let you safely retry requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice.


By default, the Zinc API will attempt to place a new order every time you send a request.  
However, if you include an `idempotency_key` in your POST request body, Zinc will guarantee that only a single order is created for that key â€” even if you retry the request due to a network error or timeout.

- **How to use:**  
  - Add a unique `"idempotency_key"` (such as a UUID or random string) to the body of any POST request
- **Behavior:**  
  - Requests with the same key will always return the same response
  - If you receive an error, you can retry with a new key
  - Once a request succeeds or fails, the order will not change for that key

## Example Idempotency Key Request

```bash
curl "https://api.zinc.io/v1/orders" \
  -u <client_token>: \
  -d '{
    "idempotency_key": "<idempotency_key>",
    "retailer": "amazon",
    "max_price": 2300,
    ...
  }'
```

<Warning>
<b>Idempotency keys are strongly recommended for all POST requests</b>  
If you retry a request after a 5XX error <b>without</b> an idempotency key, Zinc cannot guarantee deduplication and will not refund duplicate orders.
