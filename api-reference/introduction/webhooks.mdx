Webhooks let you receive real-time notifications from the Zinc API whenever important events occur (such as order status changes, tracking updates, or failures).

To use webhooks, include a `webhooks` object in your API request. This object specifies the event types you want to listen for and the URLs to notify.

**What you send:**  
The `webhooks` object in your request, specifying which events you want to receive and where.

**What you receive:**  
When an event occurs, Zinc sends a `POST` request to your specified URL(s). The body of the webhook is the same as the standard JSON response for that event (see [Object Reference](/api-reference/objects/order), etc.).

## Example Webhooks Object

```json
{
  "request_succeeded": "https://example.com/zinc/request_placed",
  "request_failed": "https://example.com/zinc/request_failed",
  "tracking_obtained": "https://example.com/zinc/tracking_obtained",
  "tracking_updated": "https://example.com/zinc/tracking_updated",
  "status_updated": "https://example.com/zinc/status_updated",
  "case_updated": "https://example.com/zinc/case_updated"
}
```

| `order_failed`        | `String` | (deprecated) Synonym for request_failed (orders only)                                         |
| `tracking_obtained`   | `String` | Webhook URL for when ALL tracking for an order is retrieved (orders only)                     |
| `tracking_updated`    | `String` | Webhook URL for when ANY tracking for an order is retrieved (orders only)                     |
| `status_updated`      | `String` | Webhook URL for when the status of a request is updated                                       |
| `case_updated`        | `String` | Webhook URL for when a ZMA case associated with the order receives an update                  |

<Note>
The <code>case_updated</code> webhook is specifically for ZMA order cases.
</Note>

- You can pass an **array of URLs** for any webhook type; Zinc will notify all of them.
- Webhooks have **"at least once" delivery**â€”your endpoint may receive the same event more than once. Deduplicate on your end if needed.
- Webhooks are **not signed**. For security, you can:
  - Include a secret query parameter or HTTP basic auth in your webhook URL (e.g., `https://user:password@example.com/zinc/tracking_obtained`)
  - Use the webhook as a trigger and re-fetch the event data from the API for verification.

<Info>
If no URL is specified for a webhook type, no notification will be sent for that event.
