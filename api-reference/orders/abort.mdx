The Zinc API allows you to abort orders that are still in the `request_processing` stage. This functionality is intended to abort an order if was made by mistake or if it is taking too long to process.

The response will be the same as if you were to [GET the order](/api-reference/orders/retrieve). If we were able to immediately abort the order, the order will have an error code of `aborted_request`.

It can take time for an order to abort and success is not guaranteed. You can either periodically poll the order to check if it was aborted or use webhooks.
