## Order Flow

Making an order request will start an order. You'll receive a `request_id` in the response which you'll then use for retrieving the status of the order. The following illustration shows the flow for a typical order.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Selecting an offer & shipping">

    When placing an order, each product will have multiple offers from different sellers each with their own shipping options. To address this, use a product's seller selection criteria to filter offers and an order's shipping parameter to specify shipping preferences. Below is a flowchart of the process used to filter offers and select a shipping option.

    </Frame>

    ### Default seller selection criteria

    If a seller selection criteria object is not explicitly provided, then the API will use the default:
    ```json
    { 
    "prime": true, 
    "handling_days_max": 6, 
    "condition_in": ["New"] 
    }
    ```

    ### Some examples

    **Tracking within 5 days:**  
    If you wanted to send your customer a tracking number within 5 days, you would set `handling_days_max` to `5` in your seller selection criteria. The Zinc API would then filter out all offers which would not ship and upload a tracking number within 5 days.

    **Handling days filtering:**  
    If you specified `"handling_days_max": 6` in your seller selection criteria, then any offer that won't ship in 6 days or less from now would be excluded from your buying selection. Thus, if two sellers are offering the same product, but one has a guaranteed shipping date 10 days away and the other seller has a guaranteed shipping date 5 days away, the second seller's offer would be selected.

    <Info>
    When no handling information is available, we use the longest projected arrival date of the product as the `handling_days_max`.
    </Info>

    **Shipping method selection:**  
    If you set `"max_days": 5` on the shipping parameter, the Zinc API would attempt to select the cheapest shipping method that took fewer than 5 days to arrive. Thus, if there was a shipping method that took 3 days and cost ten dollars and another shipping method that took 7 days but cost two dollars, the first shipping option would be selected.
