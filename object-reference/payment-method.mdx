## Payment Method Object

```json Example Payment Object
{
  "name_on_card": "Ben Bitdiddle",
  "number": "5555555555554444",
  "security_code": "123",
  "expiration_month": 1,
  "expiration_year": 2015,
  "use_gift": false
}
```

The recommended way to pay for purchases on a retailer is by using gift card balance already applied to an account. Gift cards are supported on amazon, amazon_uk, amazon_ca, and walmart. To use the existing gift balance on the account, simply pass `{"use_gift": true}` as the payment method object.

To use a credit card, you must include the `name_on_card`, `number`, `security_code`, `expiration_month`, and `expiration_year` fields. For Amazon, you should only have a single credit card associated with an account which should be the same as the card passed in the payment method object. This allows the system to correctly answer any payment-related security questions.
