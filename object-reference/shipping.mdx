## Shipping Object

```json Example Shipping Object
{
  "order_by": "price",
  "max_days": 5,
  "max_price": 1000
}
```

The shipping object gives you fine grained control over shipping speeds on your orders. Typically, there is a tradeoff between how fast your order arrives and the cost of shipping. The shipping object gives you a way to make sure that you don't go over budget and that your order still arrives on time.
