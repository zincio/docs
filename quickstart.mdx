## 1. Create your Zinc account

<a href="https://dash.zinc.io/signup" target="_blank">Sign up here</a> to get started. You will need to deposit funds into your Zinc account to use the API.

## 2. Get Your API Credentials

After signing up, visit your <a href="https://dash.zinc.io" target="_blank">Zinc dashboard</a> to find your client token.

## 3. Make Your First API Call

Here's how to fetch product details from Amazon using `curl`:

```bash
curl 'https://api.zinc.io/v1/search?query=fish%20oil&page=1&retailer=amazon' \
  -u <client_token>:
```

<Info>
Replace <code>&lt;client_token&gt;</code> with your actual token. Never share your client token publicly.
</Info>

If successful, you'll get a JSON response with product information (title, price, images, etc.).
