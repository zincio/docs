This quickstart will help you make your first API call in just a few minutes.

<Alert type="info">
  You'll need a Zinc account. <a href="https://dash.zinc.io/signup" target="_blank">Sign up here</a> if you haven't already.
</Alert>

## 1. Get Your API Credentials

After signing up, visit your <a href="https://dash.zinc.io" target="_blank">Zinc dashboard</a> to find your client token.

## 2. Make Your First API Call

Here's how to fetch product details from Amazon using `curl`:

```bash
curl 'https://api.zinc.io/v1/search?query=fish%20oil&page=1&retailer=amazon' \
  -u <client_token>:
```

<Note>
Replace <code>&lt;client_token&gt;</code> with your actual token. Never share your client token publicly.
</Note>

If successful, you'll get a JSON response with product information (title, price, images, etc.).
